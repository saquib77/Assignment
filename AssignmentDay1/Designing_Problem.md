### Designing Problem

## IOT Inverter Company

 Use Case:

    * Company have PCU, GTI, Zelio, Regalia, iCruze Inverters

    * All Inverters have Power rating which is determined by ( Current * Operating Voltage )

    * Only PCU, GTI and Regalia are solar Inverters other are not (solar inverters get charge by solar panels and solar energy)

    * Solar Inverters have Solar Panels also

    * Solar Inverters further have two option one Battery version that whatever energy is produced will be stored in battery other will not store any energy
      so PCU comes with battery but GTI have no battery

    * Solar Inverter also have GRID On , system where you can sell your extra energy back, GTI is GRID On where as this feature is not available in PCU
      Non Solar Inverters are Simple Home Inverters Which have a Battery
